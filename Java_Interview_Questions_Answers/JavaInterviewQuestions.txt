Basic Java Interview Questions and Answers
==========================================

1. What is a variable in Java?
   ---------------------------
   A variable in Java is a container that holds data values during the execution of a program. It is a name given to a memory location.

2. What are the types of variables in Java?
   ----------------------------------------
   There are three types of variables in Java:
   - Local Variables: Declared inside a method and accessible only within that method.
   - Instance Variables: Declared inside a class but outside any method and are accessible from all methods in the class.
   - Class Variables (Static Variables): Declared with the static keyword and shared among all instances of the class.

3. What are primitive data types in Java?
   --------------------------------------
   Java has 8 primitive data types:
   - byte: 8-bit integer
   - short: 16-bit integer
   - int: 32-bit integer
   - long: 64-bit integer
   - float: Single-precision 32-bit floating point
   - double: Double-precision 64-bit floating point
   - char: 16-bit Unicode character
   - boolean: Represents true or false

4. What is a literal in Java?
   --------------------------
   A literal is a fixed value that is represented directly in the code. Examples include numbers (e.g., 10), characters (e.g., 'A'), and strings (e.g., "Hello").

5. Explain the arithmetic operators in Java.
   -----------------------------------------
   Arithmetic operators are used for mathematical operations. They include:
   - Addition (+): Adds two values.
   - Subtraction (-): Subtracts one value from another.
   - Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values.
   - Division (/): Divides one value by another.
   - Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation.

6. What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` in Java?
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   - `==` checks if two references point to the same memory location (reference comparison).
   - `equals()` method checks if two objects are logically equal (value comparison).

7. How do you declare a constant in Java?
   --------------------------------------
   A constant is declared using the `final` keyword. Once assigned, its value cannot be changed.
   Example: `final int MAX_VALUE = 100;`

8. What is type casting in Java?
   -----------------------------
   Type casting is converting one data type into another. It can be implicit (automatic) or explicit (manual).
   Example of explicit casting: `double num = 10.5; int intNum = (int) num;`

9. What is the default value of an instance variable?
   --------------------------------------------------
   The default values for instance variables are:
   - int: 0
   - double: 0.0
   - char: '\u0000' (null character)
   - boolean: false
   - Objects (including String): null

10. What is the difference between `break` and `continue`?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    - `break` terminates the loop immediately and passes control to the next statement after the loop.
    - `continue` skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
