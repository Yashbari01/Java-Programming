Variables in Java
=================

Definition:
-----------
Variables are containers for storing data values. Each variable must be declared with a type, which determines what kind of values it can hold.

Declaration and Initialization:
-------------------------------
Syntax:
    type variableName = value;

Examples:
    int age = 25;
    double salary = 50000.50;
    String name = "Alice";

Types of Variables:
-------------------
1. Local Variables: Declared inside a method or a block and only accessible within that method or block.
2. Instance Variables: Declared inside a class but outside any method, and they are accessible by all methods of the class.
3. Class Variables (Static Variables): Declared with the static keyword, they belong to the class rather than instances of the class.

Example:
---------
public class Example {
    int instanceVar; // Instance variable
    static int classVar; // Class variable

    public void method() {
        int localVar = 10; // Local variable
    }
}
